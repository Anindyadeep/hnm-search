How the app would flow:

1. You start with normal recommendation like business like recommendation
2. And then you have your search bar in the bottom 
3. And then you have a sidebar
    1. You have a pretty standard sidebar with a list of categories
    2. And then you have search sessions which you can save when you enter a session
4. You have a session button
    1. You can start a session
    2. You can end a session
    3. You can save a session
    4. You can delete a session
    5. While you are in a session you can see the product with a long press
    6. Once recommendation cards end while scrolling, it automatically switches to history based recommendation and business recommendation 
5. A search bar needs to understand what kind of search to go for?
    1. Whether to go for a keyword based search
    2. Or whether to go for a search which is more text to SQL based
